# Multi Stage Multi Agent

# 🌟 First, Some Basics:

| Term | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| **Agent** | A machine (or container) where Jenkins runs the tasks. |
| **Stage** | A group of related steps inside your pipeline. Like "Build", "Test", "Deploy". |
| **Multi-Agent Pipeline** | Different parts (stages) of your pipeline run on **different agents** (machines/containers). |
| **Multi-Stage Pipeline** | Your pipeline is broken into **logical stages** — like Build Backend, Build Frontend, Deploy DB.

---

# 🎯 Your Example: 3-Tier App (Frontend + Backend + DB)

Suppose:

| Layer | Tech | What needs to happen |
|------|-----|-----------------------|
| Frontend | React.js | Build UI code, deploy to S3 |
| Backend | Spring Boot (Java) | Build .jar, Dockerize, deploy |
| Database | MySQL | Deploy Docker container, or configure DB |

---

# 🏗️ What We Want:

| Stage | What to do | Where (Agent) |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Stage 1: Build Frontend | npm install, npm build React app | Node.js agent (Docker container with Node) |
| Stage 2: Build Backend | mvn clean package, build Docker image | Java/Maven agent (Docker container with Maven+Java11) |
| Stage 3: Setup Database | Pull MySQL image, run container | Linux agent with Docker installed |

✅ Different stages.
✅ Different agents, specialized for their task.
✅ Parallel or Sequential as needed.

# 🛠️ How Multi-Agent, Multi-Stage Jenkinsfile Looks:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent none   // Don't bind the entire pipeline to one agent!

  stages {
    
    stage('Frontend Build') {
      agent {
        docker {
          image 'node:16-alpine'  // Node.js environment
        }
      }
      steps {
        sh 'cd frontend'
        sh 'npm install'
        sh 'npm run build'
        echo "Frontend build complete!"
      }
    }
    
    stage('Backend Build') {
      agent {
        docker {
          image 'maven:3.8.4-openjdk-11'  // Maven + Java 11 environment
        }
      }
      steps {
        sh 'cd backend'
        sh 'mvn clean package'
        echo "Backend build complete!"
      }
    }
    
    stage('Database Setup') {
      agent { label 'docker-agent' }  // EC2 machine or agent that has Docker installed
      steps {
        sh 'docker pull mysql:8'
        sh 'docker run -d --name mydb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root123 -p 3306:3306 mysql:8'
        echo "MySQL Database container running!"
      }
    }
    
  }
}
```

# 📦 Here’s What’s Happening:

| Stage | Agent/Environment | Task |
|-------|--------------------|-----|
| Frontend Build | Node.js docker container | Build React app |
| Backend Build | Maven + Java docker container | Build Spring Boot app |
| Database Setup | Docker-capable EC2 agent | Run MySQL database |

---

# 🧠 Why Use Multi-Agent?

- **Efficiency:** Frontend needs Node.js, Backend needs Java — no need to install both on one machine!
- **Isolation:** Different builds don’t mess with each other.
- **Flexibility:** You can run frontend build on a small agent, backend build on a bigger agent.
- **Cost-saving:** Pay only for what you need.

# ⚡ Diagram Visual:

```
Jenkins Master
    |
    |--- Stage: Frontend Build
    |         --> Node.js Agent (Docker container)
    |
    |--- Stage: Backend Build
    |         --> Maven Agent (Docker container)
    |
    |--- Stage: Database Setup
              --> Docker-enabled EC2 (physical agent)
```

---

# 🔥 Real World Example:

In real companies:

- Frontend team may have their own agent setup.
- Backend team has their own.
- DB admins have a separate environment for DB deployments.
- **Each agent specializes** in its own environment.

---
# ✨ Final Short Version:

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Multi-Stage** | Different steps: build frontend, build backend, deploy DB |
| **Multi-Agent** | Each step can run on its own specialized agent (different machines/containers) |

---

# 🚀 Bonus Tip:

You can even **parallelize** the builds for faster pipelines:
```groovy
stages {
  stage('Build') {
    parallel {
      stage('Frontend') { ... }
      stage('Backend') { ... }
    }
  }
}
```
💥 This will run **Frontend** and **Backend** builds at the **same time** on **different agents**!

---

# 📢 So to wrap up:

✅ Multi-Agent = Different environments for different jobs.  
✅ Multi-Stage = Logical separation of build, test, deploy.  
✅ 3-Tier App = PERFECT example to use Multi-Agent Multi-Stage pipeline!
